Interface is designed as a guide, so everything happens in a few simple steps.

# 1. size selection #

Here you can choose of either 3x3 (8-puzzle), or 4x4 (15-puzzle). Maybe in the next release you will be able to choose a puzzle of any size. Who knows :-)


# 2. enter the original image #

In this step, you have to select an image that shows how the solved puzzle looks like. You have 3 options, because jqPuzzle is not always configured to display the resulting image on your demand. In that case, you can download a picture or enter the web address directly, just as shown in the sample video.

Important: if you select the screen region, you need to select the picture as accurately as possible (see video).


# 3. board configuration #

Now you only need to specify how the individual tiles are distributed on the board. You can enter the board configuration into a text field or you can select the screen region in which the board is situated - the selection needn't to be precise - you can select full screen and it will still work in most cases.


# 4. solution #

After clicking on the "View Results & Solve" button, a list of moves that are needed to successfully solve the given puzzle is displayed alongside the puzzle board simulating the game.
