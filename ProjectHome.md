# jqPuzzle Solver #

_This is my "just4fun" AI mini-project. It automaticaly solves the jQuery Puzzle. I started to develop this utility bacause of some competitions by UAX clothing company, because I wanted to win - and I've already won :-) But I've decided to take it to another level. The original 3x3 puzzle solver was written in C++, but the current stable version (3x3 and 4x4 puzzle solver) was rewritten to C#, because I wanted to learn the language and I wanted to make the application as user-friendly as it was possible._


## Current state ##

Puzzle solver already works for the both 3x3 and 4x4 puzzles and it can automatically recognize most of the puzzles.

## Future work ##

The project is finished for now, but there can be still some improvements to the solver. Now it looks for optimal solution, hence the puzzle dimensions are limited. The future work could conclude solving a puzzle of any dimensions using an advanced optimization technique.
